Explain what happens when you run the threadSync.c program?
	
	10 threads are created in a for loop and passed the function go(void* arg). 
	The order at which the threads run is indeterminate due to the scheduler. 
	However, a semaphore is taken out at at the beginning of the threads' function call.
	Since the semaphore is initialized to 1, the first thread chosen by the scheduler will continue.
	Each thread prints a statement and then releases the semaphore, decrements the counter, and wakes a waiting thread.
